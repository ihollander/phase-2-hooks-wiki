# Code Challenge Format

I've had success giving the students two chances at the code challenge in week
two. Round one will give struggling students a chance to practice and get
feedback on their submissions, while students who are confident with the
material should have a good chance of success. Round two will give them a chance
to immediately implement that feedback and try again.

## Methodology

- Inform students that they will have two chances to take code challenge this week
- All students will be given feedback in Canvas, including areas of improvement

## Round 1

- Students who don't pass round 1 will take round 2 the next day
  - They are also required to attend a review lecture of the round 1 code challenge
- Students who do pass round 1 can be paired together to start projects early

## Round 2

- Students who pass round 2 can be paired together for projects
- Students who don't pass round 2 can work on a along with another take-home 
  code challenge in week three
  
## Round 3: Guided Project/Take Home Code Challenge

Students should work on a [guided solo project][] to demonstrate mastery of React.
They should also complete a take-home code challenge (Planeteers) and submit
that for feedback.

As I mentioned, here is some info about the two things to work on this week for the retake. Let us know if you have any follow up questions! Your coach will set up some times to meet 1-1 to check in on your progress.

*Retake Code Challenge*

Here’s a link to the second round code challenge:

Treat this like a normal code challenge in terms of resources - solve it without your notes/labs/lesson code. You can work on it any time you like, but you must submit by 12pm next Wednesday at the latest.

When you’re done, message us and let us know and we will find some time to review. It’s ok if you want to try it early and take another shot at it later - we mostly want a chance to talk to you about your React code to get a sense of your understanding, so you are welcome to take it more than once.

*Guided Project*

- https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/react-hooks-evernote-json-server-guided-project

Here’s the timeline you should try to follow (you can work faster if you’re feeling confident):

- Thursday: Viewing All Notes and Displaying Individual Notes
- Friday: Creating Notes
- Monday: Filtering Notes
- Tuesday: Editing Notes (this one is a bit tricky, so let us know if you get stuck!)

Each of these deliverables is roughly on scale of an advanced code challenge deliverable, so they shouldn’t take too much time out of your day - and will be good practice for the retake. Like I mentioned, we’ll use the project as well as the retake to gauge your React understanding, so you effectively have two ways to pass into phase 3.
