# Code Challenge Format

I've had success giving the students two chances at the code challenge in week
two. Round one will give struggling students a chance to practice and get
feedback on their submissions, while students who are confident with the
material should have a good chance of success. Round two will give them a chance
to immediately implement that feedback and try again.

For projects, students who pass round 1 can be paired together and start early
on their projects, or begin reviewing React Router labs.

If they don't pass the second round, they can work on a
[guided solo project](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/react-hooks-evernote-json-server-guided-project)
along with another take-home code challenge in week three to determine if they
pass the phase and can move on.
