# Phase 2 React Hooks Schedule

## Notes

In Canvas, there are links to some external Scrimba playlists that I recorded -
feel free to use them if you find them useful. They show up throughout each
module and are aligned with the content covered in that module.

## Prework

The weekend prior to starting the phase, deploy these lab sections:

- Welcome to Phase 2
- Introduction to React

There's not much content here, so the students have a chance to get a mental
break between Phase 1 and 2. The priority is to give them some minimal exposure
to React and spark curiosity for how it will make the job of creating a single
page application easier.

Example Slack Message:

```txt
*@channel* I hope you’re excited for React! There’s not a lot of homework
required for the weekend since we know you all need time to rest. Please just
work on the Introduction to React section in Canvas (labs with a :star: are most
important):

*Welcome to Phase 2!*
• Welcome to Phase 2 :star:

*Introduction to React*
• What is React? :star:
• Intro to npm
• npm Code-Along
• A React App Example :star:
• Running Tests in React

If you’re feeling motivated, you can continue onto other sections, but we’ll
have time starting Monday to move ahead with the rest of the labs.

In future sections, you'll notice some Scrimba Playlist links at the top of some
sections. Scrimba is an awesome interative screencast tool that will let you
watch short instructional videos and get your hands on the code. I highly
recommend checking them out to supplement the labs and readmes.

Finally, here’s a version of the React docs that uses the functions/hooks syntax
we’ll be teaching. The React docs are an awesome resource and are definitely
worth reading through this weekend and referencing as you learn more. *Bookmark
this page!!*

• React with Hooks docs: https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/

See you all Monday!
